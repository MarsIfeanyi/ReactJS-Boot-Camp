/**
 * React is a JS library for building user interfaces. HTML and CSS are used to build user interface, however React makes building complex interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.
 *
 * Hint: React is all about Component, because all UIs are made up of components.
 *
 * Components are reusable building blocks in your user interface. Components is a combination of HTML codes, Css for styling and possibly JS for some logic.
 *
 * Why Components?
 * 1. Reusability: Helps us to avoid repetition
 * 2. Separation of Concerns: Helps us to keep our code base small and manageable.
 *
 * React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JS(and CSS).
 * React uses a declarative approach for building components ie you define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
 *
 *Hint: Component is a JavaScript function which typically returns HTML(JSX) code that should be displayed ie the JSX Code contains the React Elements.
 
 Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
An element describes what you want to see on the screen

Hint: Always start component name with capital letters, React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags
