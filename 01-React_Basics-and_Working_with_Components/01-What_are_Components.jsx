/**
 * React is a JS library for building user interfaces. HTML and CSS are used to build user interface, however React makes building complex interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.
 *
 * Hint: React is all about Component, because all UIs are made up of components.
 *
 * Components are reusable building blocks in your user interface. Components is a combination of HTML codes, Css for styling and possibly JS for some logic.
 *
 * Why Components?
 * 1. Reusability: Helps us to avoid repetition
 * 2. Separation of Concerns: Helps us to keep our code base small and manageable.
 *
 * React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JS(and CSS).
 * React uses a declarative approach for building components ie you define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
