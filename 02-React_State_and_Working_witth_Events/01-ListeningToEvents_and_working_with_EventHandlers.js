/**
 * In react we add an event listener by going to the JSX element like the 'button' and there we add as special prop... Prop with starts with 'on'.
 *
 * Hint: React expose all the default event which starts with 'on' as props.
 * The value assigned to the special prop is a function which contains code that should be executed when certain operation happens and we just point at the function inside {} ie you don't add () after the function name
