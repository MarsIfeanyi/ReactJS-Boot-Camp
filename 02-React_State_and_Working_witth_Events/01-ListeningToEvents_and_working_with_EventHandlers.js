 * Hint: In react we add an event listener by going to the JSX element like the 'button' and there we add as special prop... Prop which starts with 'on' keyword.
 *
 * Hint: React expose all the default event which starts with 'on' as props.
 * The value assigned to the special prop is a function which contains code that should be executed when certain operation happens and we just point at the function inside {} ie you don't add () after the function name.
